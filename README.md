# BusWasabi

BusWasabi is a WebApp that displays the locations of busses in Seattle determined by GPS recievers. When a bus is selected, BusWasabi also displays the predicted position of the bus and simulates the movement of the bus based on schedule and schedule deviation data.

Technologgies Used:

BusWasabi uses SoundTransit's OneBusAway API to obtain locations of busses, the bus schedules and routing information. BusWasabi uses the Leaflet mobile mapping framework along with several plugins to show the busses on the map.
